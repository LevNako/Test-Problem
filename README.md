# Test-Problem
Having created a project of type Maven in the main folder you will find all the necessary classes to download , download them and place them in a new project, in the test folder there are tests for this project, also put them in the project, in the file pom.xml you will find all the necessary configuration.
This project I implemented through the map : key - date, value - a list of products, all the necessary methods are available.
